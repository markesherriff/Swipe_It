React to the command quickly to stay alive. Anybody can play Swipe It!


'Swipe It' is an endless game of reacting to the various commands. If you fail to follow the instructions, GAME OVER! This simple game will have anybody of any age screaming with joy.

### Behind the Scenes
Solely build with React Native, Swipe It was a fun project build by Mark Sherriff when he was learning to use the technologies. Fun fact, the animated arrows you see in the game are accomplished with Animated View Components. This way of doing things is not very robust, although it was meant to push the limits and see what React was possible of!
